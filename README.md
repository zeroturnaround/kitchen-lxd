# <a name="title"></a> Kitchen::Lxd

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zeroturnaround/kitchen-lxd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zeroturnaround/kitchen-lxd)

A Test Kitchen Driver for Lxd.

## <a name="requirements"></a> Requirements

### Lxd

Lxd version of 2.3 (the one where "lxc network" commands were introduced) or higher is required for
this driver which means that a native package must be installed on the system running Test Kitchen.
You must also prepare an image to be used by Test Kitchen. For that make sure there is ssh daemon
installed and starting on boot. ( On Ubuntu it can be done by simply installing 'openssh-server'
package. ) You can also install Chef Client there, if you do not want Test Kitchen to install it
every time a container is generated from the image.

## <a name="installation"></a> Installation and Setup

Install using command line:

```bash
gem install kitchen-lxd
```

## <a name="config"></a> Configuration

Available options:

- image
- container
- require_chef_omnibus

### image

Define from which lxd image the container will be created.

```yaml
---
driver:
  image: ubuntu/xenial/amd64
```

The default is value of `platform name`.

```yaml
---
platforms:
  - name: kitchen-xenial64
```

In this case: 'kitchen-xenial64', expecting to have an lxd image with this name locally.

### container

Created container name.

```yaml
---
driver:
  container_name: my_name
```

The default is value of `kitchen instance name`.

```yaml
---
platforms:
  - name: kitchen-xenial64

suites:
  - name: webserver
```

In this case: 'webserver-kitchen-xenial64'.

### <a name="config-require-chef-omnibus"></a> require\_chef\_omnibus

Determines whether or not a Chef [Omnibus package][chef_omnibus_dl] will be
installed. There are several different behaviors available:

- `true` - the latest release will be installed. Subsequent converges
  will skip re-installing if chef is present.
- `latest` - the latest release will be installed. Subsequent converges
  will always re-install even if chef is present.
- `<VERSION_STRING>` (ex: `10.24.0`) - the desired version string will
  be passed the the install.sh script. Subsequent converges will skip if
  the installed version and the desired version match.
- `false` or `nil` - no chef is installed.

The default value is unset, or `nil`.
